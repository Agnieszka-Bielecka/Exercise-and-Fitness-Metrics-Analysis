# Exercise and Fitness Metrics Analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Introduction
Exercise and Fitness Metrics dataset contains information about different types of performed exercises (duration, calories burned during those exercises, weather, and intensity of exercise), and details about the exerciser (dream weight, actual weight, age, gender, heart rate, and BMI). I used this data to find out if there are some intresting information about exercise overall.

### Analyzed questions
1. What level of heart rate is the most recommended for people of a particular age?
2. Which exercises are the most efficient (burn the most calories)?
3. What is given people's height?
4. Is there any correlation between given variables?
5. What is the distribution of actual weight in the given dataset?
6. How given people are categorized in relation to their BMI?

### Tools
Python for Data Cleaning, Data Visualisation and Data Analysis.
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scipy.stats (shapiro).

### Dataset
The data set is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aakashjoshi123/exercise-and-fitness-metrics-dataset).
